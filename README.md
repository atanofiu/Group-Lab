# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Instructions on how the Game works

The Rock Paper Scissors game is a simple two-player game where each player chooses one of three options: 
rock, paper, or scissors. The winner is determined based on the choices made by the players according to the following algorithm:

i.   Rock crushes scissors (Rock wins against scissors)
ii.  Scissors cuts paper (Scissors win against paper)
iii. Paper covers rock (Paper wins against rock)

If both players choose the same option, the game becomes a "tie".
