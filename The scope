Project Scope:

This project is about making a simple web app for playing "Rock, Paper, Scissors". 
Two players can pick rock, paper, or scissors, and the winner is decided based on the game's rules. 
The game shows what each player picked and who won. 

We'll use Python for the game's logic, Flask for building the web app, and HTML/CSS for the user interface.

This project keeps things basic. 
It won't have advanced features like multiplayer or AI opponents. 
We're focusing on simplicity, making sure it works well, and being easy to use.
